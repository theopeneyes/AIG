              "'The economy of India is a middle income developing market economy. It is the worlds fifthlargest economy by nominal GDP and the thirdlargest by purchasing power parity PPP. According to the International Monetary Fund IMF on a per capita income basis India ranked 142nd by GDP nominal and 128th by GDP PPP. From independence in 1947 until 1991 successive governments promoted protectionist economic policies with extensive state intervention and economic regulation. This is characterised as dirigism in the form of the License Raj. The end of the Cold War and an acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 led to the adoption of a broad economic liberalisation in India. Since the start of the 21st century annual average GDP growth has been 6 to and from 2013 to 2018 India was the worlds fastest growing major economy surpassing China. Historically India was the largest economy in the world for most of the two millennia from the 1st until the 19th century. The longterm growth perspective of the Indian economy remains positive due to its young population and corresponding low dependency ratio healthy savings and investment rates increasing globalisation in India and integration into the global economy. The economy was slowed in 2017 due to the shocks of demonetisation in 2016 and the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax in 2017. Nearly 70 of Indias GDP is driven by domestic private consumption. The country remains the worlds sixthlargest consumer market. Apart from private consumption Indias GDP is also fueled by government spending investments and exports. In 2020 pandemic had affected trade and India was the worlds 14thlargest importer and the 21stlargest exporter. India has been a member of the World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995. It ranks 63rd on the Ease of doing business index and 68th on the Global Competitiveness Report. Due to extreme rupeedollar rate fluctuations Indias nominal GDP too fluctuates significantly. With 50 crore 500 million workers the Indian labour force is the worlds secondlargest. India has one of the worlds highest number of billionaires and extreme income inequality. Because of several exemptions barely 2 of Indians pay income taxes. During the 2008 global financial crisis the economy faced a mild slowdown. India undertook stimulus measures both fiscal and monetary to boost growth and generate demand. In subsequent years economic growth revived. According to the World Bank to achieve sustainable economic development India must focus on public sector reform infrastructure agricultural and rural development removal of land and labour regulations financial inclusion spur private investment and exports education and public health. In 2020 Indias ten largest trading partners were United States China United Arab Emirates UAE Saudi Arabia Switzerland Germany Hong Kong Indonesia South Korea and Malaysia. In 2019–20 the foreign direct investment FDI in India was 74.4 billion. The leading sectors for FDI inflows were the service sector the computer industry and the telecom industry. India has free trade agreements with several nations including ASEAN SAFTA Mercosur South Korea Japan and several others which are in effect or under negotiating stage. The service sector makes up 50 of GDP and remains the fastest growing sector while the industrial sector and the agricultural sector employs a majority of the labor force. The Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange are some of the worlds largest stock exchanges by market capitalisation. India is the worlds sixthlargest manufacturer representing 2.6 of global manufacturing output. Nearly 66 of Indias population is and contributes about 50 of Indias GDP. It has the worlds fourthlargest foreignexchange reserves worth 601.057 billion. India has a high public debt with 86 of GDP while its fiscal deficit stood at 6.7 of GDP. Indias governmentowned banks faced mounting bad debt resulting in low credit growth. Simultaneously the NBFC sector has been engulfed in a liquidity crisis. India faces moderate unemployment rising income inequality and a drop in aggregate demand. Indias gross domestic savings rate stood at 30.1 of GDP in FY 2019. In recent years independent economists and financial institutions have accused the government of manipulating various economic data especially GDP growth. India is the worlds largest manufacturer of generic drugs and its pharmaceutical sector fulfills over 50 of the global demand for vaccines. The Indian IT industry is a major exporter of IT services with 196 billion in revenue and employs over 4.47 million people. Indias chemical industry is extremely diversified and estimated at 178 billion. The tourism industry contributes about 9.2 of Indias GDP and employs over 4.2 crore 42 million people. India ranks second globally in food and agricultural production while agricultural exports were 35.09 billion. The construction and real estate sector ranks third among the 14 major sectors in terms of direct indirect and induced effects in all sectors of the economy. The Indian textiles industry is estimated at 100 billion and contributes 13 of industrial output and 2.3 of Indias GDP while employs over 4.5 crore 45 million people directly.
